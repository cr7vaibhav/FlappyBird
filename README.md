# Flappy Bird

Using this FlappyBird project made by ImKennyYip to learn Java Swing/awt, how to create a game loop, create a jframe and jpanel, draw images on the jpanel, add click handlers to make the flappy bird jump, randomly generate pipes and move them across the screen, detect collisions between the flappy bird and each pipe, and add a running score.
